# Orange-bush!
A [website](https://orange-bush-0a396ce03.azurestaticapps.net/) for monitoring your plants with some added [machine learning](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet).
## What the project does
Exposes a Vue.js & Nuxt.js app that acts like the frontend for the [website](https://orange-bush-0a396ce03.azurestaticapps.net/).
## Why the project is useful
It really isn't unless you like plants or machine learning or you're us and like us want to graduate.
## How users can get started with the project
Don't. In reality the project is hosted in Azure Cloud using App service for the REST Api, Azure static app service for the frontend Api, Azure Database for PostgreSQL for the database and (hopefully) Azure Functions for the machine learning bit as soon as we train the model[s].
## Who maintains and contributes to the project
Probably us. [Andrei](https://github.com/iandrei250) handles the frontend written in JS and the backend/machine learning is handled by [Martin](https://github.com/Nitramzz) and [Luis](https://github.com/LuigiElo).
